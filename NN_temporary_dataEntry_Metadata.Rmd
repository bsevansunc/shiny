# Metadata for temporary entry of Neighborhood Nestwatch data  


This document provides descriptions of fields where you will be _temporarily_ entering your Nestwatch data in the nnTemporaryDataEntryWorkbook at the link that you were provided. This workbook is divided into three worksheets (see tabs at the bottom of the page: 

1. **Visit data:** These data only need to be entered once for each site visit and are a measure of total effort at a site. **Do not enter banding, resight, point count, nest, or habitat survey data prior to completing visit data!**  
2. **Encounter data:** Encounter data includes banding, recapture, and resight data. Each row of this spreadsheet is an individual observation of a bird. For example, if a bird was observed three times, each observation would be its own record (i.e., row).  
3. **Point count data:** Data from point counts, see field desciptions below for more information.

***

## Visit data  
Each of the column descriptions below will be followed by the worksheet column letters in parentheses.

**Hub (A):** The name of the hub associated with a site. Choices include: Atlanta, DC, Gainesville, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, or Springfield.  


**Site (B):** The site is the first four letters of the last name of the participant, the first three letters of their first name, the two-letter state abbreviation, and a number that signifies whether a participant has moved. For example, if a participant was named Robert Reitsma, they lived in Maryland, and this was the original Nestwatch site associated with the participant, the site would be REITROBMD1. If the participant moved to a new location, the site code for the new location would be REITROBMD2.

**Date (C):** The calendar date of a visit. Provide dates as M/DD/YYYY. For example, March 15, 2016 would be reported as 3/15/2016. _Note: If you visited a site on multiple dates, you would enter visit data for each visit separately._)  

**Observer (D):** Enter the three-letter initials of EACH technician who visited the site, separating observers with a comma. For example, if Thomas Brandt Ryder and Brian S. Evans visited a site, they would enter "TBR,BSE" in this field. If the technician does not have a middle name, you may enter their two-letter initials. Please be sure to use the same initials across all of your visits!  

**Longitude and latitude (E:F):** Only record/provide location (longitude or latitude) data if you took a new location reading with a GPS unit (e.g., moved site center or new site). When recording your location, be sure that your GPS unit is set to WGS 1984 and the coordinate format is decimal degrees.  

**Accuracy (G):** The accuracy of your GPS reading, reported in meters.

**Location notes (H):** Any further information on the location of the site. For example, perhaps you moved the site center ... that information goes here.

**netCountX (I:L):** This is the total number of nets you put out of a given size (6, 9, 12, or 18 meters), regardless of whether a net was moved or a net was put up later in the day.

**netTimeX (M:P):**: This is the total time, in minutes, in which nets of a given size class were open. For example, if you had three 6 m nets open for a period of two hours each, the total time in minutes would be  3 nets x (60 minutes per hour x 2 hours) = 360 minutes.  

**startRsTime and endRsTime (Q:R):** These are the times in which you began and ended your targeted resight foray. All times are to be entered in the 24-hour clock (ISO 8601 time) format. For example, 1 pm would be provided as 13:00. **_Note: targeted resighting does not include time spent at a site doing other activities (e.g., nest searching or banding)._**  

**rsPathDistance (S):** If you had a GPS unit with you, this is the path distance that you recorded on your GPS unit, in meters.

**sppUnbanded (T:AF):** As a measure of resight effort, we would like you to record the number of unbanded individuals of focal species observed during your _targeted_ resight foray. Only include counts of species that were previously color-banded at the current site.  For example, if no CARWs were ever color-banded at that site, do not count unbanded CARW during your foray. If you have encountered all individuals for a given species prior to targeted resighting, do not record counts for this species. _Note: unch represents "unidentified Chickadee"", for use if you live in a region with both Black-capped and Carolina Chichadee"._

**encounteredBird (AG):** Did you band or encounter banded birds during your visit? We want you to keep track of your visits regardless of whether you encountered a banded bird during your visit. It sometimes happens that you are not successful in your efforts to band or re-encounter a bird during a visit. Simply answer "yes" or "no".

**notes (AH):** Have anything else to say about your visit (not about individual birds)? Put it here!

## Encounter data:


**Hub (A):** The name of the hub associated with a site. Choices include: Atlanta, DC, Gainesville, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, or Springfield.  


**Site (B):** The site is the first four letters of the last name of the participant, the first three letters of their first name, the two-letter state abbreviation, and a number that signifies whether a participant has moved. For example, if a participant was named Robert Reitsma, they lived in Maryland, and this was the original Nestwatch site associated with the participant, the site would be REITROBMD1. If the participant moved to a new location, the site code for the new location would be REITROBMD2.

**Date (C):** The calendar date of a visit. Provide dates as M/DD/YYYY. For example, March 15, 2016 would be reported as 3/15/2016.

**Time (D):** The time in which you began processing the bird (24-hour clock). 
**Observer (E):** Enter the three-letter initials of the technician (or technicians) who measured the bird. If multiple technicians measured the same bird, include all of the technicians' initials, separating each with a comma. If the encounter record represents a resight by a participant, enter "participant" in this field.

**Encounter_type (F):** Encounter types include:  

* Band: Initial banding of bird
* Recap: the bird was recaptured
* Resight-incidental: The bird was resighted by a technician during the visit, but not during the targetted resighting foray
* Resight-targetted: The bird was resighted by a technician during the targetted resighting foray
* Resight-participant: The bird was resighted by the participant  

_Note: If the encounter type is a resight, leave the measurement fields (L:U) blank._  

**Species (G):** The species of bird provided as the four-letter AOU alpha code. **Please only include species that are Neighborhood Nestwatch focal species.** While species lists vary by regional hub, current species associated with this project include:
